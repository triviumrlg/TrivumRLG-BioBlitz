  To keep the installation of this demo simple, a basic HTML redirect is used to
  push us to an (ugly) demo.cgi URL.  Users of this code are free to install
  rewrite handlers, or implement other dispatching mechanisms to have pretty URLs
  on their system.
-->
You should be automatically redirected to <a href="../demo.cgi">demo.cgi.  If you are not, click <a href="../demo.cgi">here</a>
